## Windows

If you are developing on Windows, unfortunately we do not provided powershell ports and instructions at this time. In the future we may append powershell commands. In the mean-time your best bet is to use a VM with Ubuntu, and set up your development environment inside this VM. If you're an advanced Window's developer familiar with porting Linux instructions, you should encounter minimal issues.
