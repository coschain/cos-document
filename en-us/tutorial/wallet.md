### Tips

All commands below is execuated in interactive mode and wallet has been connected with local coschain.
All commands can pass flag **--help** to know how to use

## Account

There is two type of account in coschain. One is called local account, the other is called chain account.

### Local account

Local account is a keystore file, located in `~/.coschain`. A keystore file is a json format file contains a encrypted private key and a public key. Keystore file can be created/imported through wallet-cli.

A keystore file looks like:

```json
{  
   "Name":"testuser",
   "PubKey":"COS745h9zeER6qea8q9GVnRVvia7dHXnbPSAKvF84SbwSdzBG5pa1",
   "Cipher":"AES-256",
   "CipherText":"Bo3DR/lPtrfau4CsgHBFR4jPE78fPUnY5xY9pO6OKhuMe5fTZ2jxPd8MJDzcqiFSf7o=",
   "Iv":"Bj8mdb0z8JAFrAdvNSl+Sw==",
   "Mac":"sgZbYnWPF26v4cWbhIA6BhMKOxvEVPm/NwEpcViHkYE=",
   "Version":1
}
```

Name refers to a coschain account name.

### Coschain account

If an account were created, its information could be queried from chain include balance, vest etc.

### Local Account List

**List local accounts**

```shell
./wallet-cli
> list
```

**Result**

```shell
> list
account: initminer15 | status:   locked
account:  initminer2 | status:   locked
account:  initminer5 | status:   locked
account: initminer11 | status:   locked
account: initminer16 | status:   locked
```

**Look through account key pair**

```shell
./wallet-cli
> info initminer10
```

**Result**

```shell
> info initminer10
account: initminer10
pub_key: COS8fV44EgGUWjEKddPbfrXAaqYxYes4M99KLHYBwrXEj3hWP4XPr
priv_key: 4UKbH7TDr6FgFXNjzQdX3ucAXndzY4h7YBNNgnqjtUeLJkFXVg
status: unlocked
```

**Look through account info in coschain**

```shell
./wallet-cli
> account get initminer
```

**Result**

```shell
> account get initminer
GetAccountByName detail: {
	"info": {
		"account_name": "initminer",
		"coin": "6499969988.999988 COS",
		"vest": "0.000000 VEST",
		"public_key": "COS5JVLLcTPhq4Unr194JzWPDNSYGoMcam8yxnsjgRVo3Nb7ioyFW",
		"created_time": "1970/1/1 00:00:00",
		"trx_count": 19,
		"vote_power": 1000,
		"stamina_free_remain": 95304,
		"stamina_stake_remain": 864000000000,
		"stamina_max": 864000100000,
		"stake_vest_for_me": "11.000000 VEST",
		"withdraw_remains": "0.000000 VEST",
		"withdraw_each_time": "0.000000 VEST",
		"next_withdraw_time": "1970/1/1 00:00:00",
		"bp_vote_count": 1,
        ...
```

### Import account through private key

If knew a chain account with a private key, but there were not a keystore file in local. `import` command is required to import private key and generate keystore file. It usually occurs switching into a new device.

```shell
./wallet-cli
> import initminer 4DjYx2KAGh1NP3dai7MZTLUBMMhMBPmwouKE8jhVSESywccpVZ
```

In local environment, initminer's private key is *4DjYx2KAGh1NP3dai7MZTLUBMMhMBPmwouKE8jhVSESywccpVZ*, you can import it through above command.

### Create account through wallet.

Similar with EOS, user cannot create account by themself but have to be created by others who already has a coschain's account.

In local environment, initminer has enough COS to create an account

```shell
./wallet-cli
> create initminer testuser1
```

the command will remind to input a passphrase which is used to encrypt private key. Use a strong passphrase and keep keystore in safe place.

Coschain restricts account name's length from 6 to 16 and lower letters.

Executing `create` command will create a coschain account and create a keystore file in local. The key-pair is generated by random, using `info` to look through.

### Generate mnemonic then create account from it.

Contentos implements standard [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki) protocol which allows you to generate key-pair from mnemonic.

Step 1 generate mnemonic.

```shell
./wallet-cli
> genKeyPair
Mnemonic: donate shaft leisure fashion basic oyster knock saddle broken prevent junior entire cake slice payment always direct system forum require smile bus follow expire
Public  Key:  COS7hGNoSNyAwUZ3kgkjFa4RCmsjcuZNxS2q2mfhMMML6CYZ5Dtqs
Private Key:  3PMfB7RY5irkcKTzRtWje3G4mhKRiGHYrriKDxyshxNdN4eAkN
```

the mnemonic *donate shaft leisure fashion basic oyster knock saddle broken prevent junior entire cake slice payment always direct system forum require smile bus follow expire* could map into the key-pair.

Then create account from

```shell
./wallet-cli
> create_from_mnemonic initminer testuser2
```

### Import/Lock/Unlock local accounts

Local account could be lock state or unlock state. When an account locaked, its private key is encrypted so could not be used to sign transaction. It should be unlocked first.

```shell
./wallet-cli
> unlock initminer
```

Input the passphrase to unlock.

You can also `lock` an account.

When coschain started, it would import all keystore files under `~/.coschain`, you can `load` keystore file which located in different path. All loaded account is locked.

If a unlocked account had no operation for a short while, it automatically locked itself.
