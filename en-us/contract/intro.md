# Smart Contract

The contentos main chain has supported smart contract, but the relative toolchain still on early day.

By now, any contract can not execute in testnet. You can try the feature in local though wallet-cli by `deploy` and `call` commands.

The contract is wasm format, converted from a customized cpp. More detail will release in the future as well as the toolchain.
