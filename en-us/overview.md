# Contentos

## Overview

Contentos (aka. coschain) is a blockchain focus on content creating. Users take part in our ecosystem by post, reply or vote. We encourage users to create and users can be benefitted from it. More weighted vote power a user have and more benefit he will be awarded.

## COS/VEST/Chicken

Coschain introduces weighted vote power (aka. vp) to quantify how much an action like post or vote sent by a user  can contribute to coschain. The VP of post is simple the sum of users' VP who vote to the post. Vp bases on user's VEST balance. A user who have more VEST balance, each vote he can contribute more VP to a post.

In Coschain, the basic currency is called COS, it hold 6 digits after the decimal point. COS can be converted to VEST or Chicken. The different of COS and VEST/Chicken is that COS can tranfer from each other without restriction but VEST/Chicken cannot.

VEST refers user's power in coschain system. As mentioned above, a user who holds more VEST, he can contribute more in each vote, and the author of the post which voted by the voter can award more when the post is cashouted. If anyone who want to become to block producer(aka. BP), at least 30,000 VEST is required.

COS can convert to VEST immediately and without restrictions but convert VEST to COS need 13 weeks.

Chicken is similar with VEST like both of them are converted from COS and cannot convert to COS immediately. But they actually are different. A user wants to convert COS to Chicken because of he wanted to acquire stamina. In coschain, execute an operation does not spend fee like BTC or ETH does but spends stamina. every day, each user can receive some free stamina from system which is enough to execuate some basic operations. But for a user who wants to send a large amount of transaction, he need stake some COS to Chicken. More Chicken a user hold, more capacity of stamina the user have. Stamina can self-recover, and whole capacity stamina will be fulfilled in one day.
